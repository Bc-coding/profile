## Welcome to My Profile!

Hi there, my name is Belle. 

### About Me

I am from Taiwan and my family and I relocated to the UK in 2016. We are currently living in Leeds.

I've always been interested in design. In 2019, I was randomly looking for some opportunities to develop creativity or a new skill. I came across some blogs about UX/UI design and web development. At first I was simply interested in finding out how websites are created. Then I went throught some learning resources on FreeCodeCamp, Mozilla, Udemy, erc... The more I code, the more I became hooked with coding. 

I love the element of problem solving in programming and really enjoy the process of creating beautiful webpages. As most of my learning to code is self-taught, I would love to join some communities and meet other people who share the same interests in web development. 

I am super excited to join Coders Guild JAMstack course. I look forward to meeting other participants and deepening my knowledge in JAMstack.
