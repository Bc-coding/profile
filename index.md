## Welcome to My Profile!

Hi there, my name is Belle. 

### About Me

I started learning to code in Dec 2019 as my hobby, at first I was simply interested in finding out how websites are created. 
I went through responsive web design certificate on FreeCodeCamp, then learning resources on Mozilla, some JavaScript courses on Udemy. 
The more I code, the more I became hooked with coding. 

I love the element of problem solving in programming and really enjoy the process of creating beautiful webpages. 
As most of my learning to code is self-taught, I would love to join some communities and meet other people who share the same interests in web development. 

I am super excited to join Coders Guild JAMstack course. I look forward to meeting other participants and building some interesting projects!
