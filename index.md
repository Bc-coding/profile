## Welcome to My Profile!

Hi there, my name is Belle. 

### About Me

I am from Taiwan and currenly living in Leeds. I was working in the tax consulting firms in Taiwan and Singapore before my family and I relocated to Leeds. After the birth of my first child, I decided to take a break from my previous career. 

I've always been interested in design. In 2019, I was randomly looking for some opportunities to develop creativity or a new skill. Then I came across some blogs about UX/UI design and web development. At first I was simply interested in finding out how websites are created. The more I code, the more I became hooked with coding. 

I love the element of problem solving in programming and really enjoy the process of creating beautiful webpages. As most of my learning to code is self-taught, I would love to join some communities and meet other people who share the same interests in web development. 

I am super excited to join Coders Guild JAMstack course. I look forward to meeting other participants and deepening my knowledge in JAMstack.
